# An OpenSSL::X509::Attribute representing an extension request is a Set
# containing an array of one Sequence object, which itself holds an array of
# extension objects. These extension objects may be represented in different
# ways, and this object encapsulates those differences (see note on
# `all_extensions` method below.)
#
# Indeed, this object abstracts away all of the above implementation detail,
# allowing us to:
#
# 1. Easily create the "attribute value" from an array of extensions
# 2. Look up individual extensions by name
